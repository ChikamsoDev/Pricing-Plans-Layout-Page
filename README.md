# Pricing Plans Layout Page

A responsive pricing plans layout built with **HTML and CSS**.  
This project demonstrates clean layout structure, flexible card design, hover interactions, and mobile responsiveness using **Flexbox**.

## 🔍 Overview

The page displays three pricing tiers — **Basic**, **Pro**, and **Premium** — each presented as a card with clear pricing, feature lists, and call-to-action buttons.

The **Pro plan** is visually emphasized to reflect common real-world SaaS pricing strategies.
